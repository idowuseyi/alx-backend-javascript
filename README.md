ALX Backend Javascript
Description

This repository contains codes written for Backend Javascript at the ALX Software engineering course in conjunction with Holberton school of computer science. In these projects, i have learnt the Javascript programming language, and i have used skills acquired to solving numerous tasks which have been duly documented in this repo. simultaneously, I continued to expand my skills in python programming language and shell scripting, while advancing my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithm. This repo could serve as a source of learning material for aspiring Backend Software engineer with Javascript Programming Language.
